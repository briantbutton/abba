# ABBA

AtoB and BtoA conversion with greater compactness than the Javascript standard.

### Why I build this

I put metadata all over the place, usually text strings with user-entered prose.&nbsp;
Sometimes JSON.&nbsp;
These spaces have different restrictions but Base 64 characters are universally safe.&nbsp;
A couple of these places have tight space limitations.&nbsp;

So I built this utility, which I use to "defang" strings so I can jam them into corners.


### Intended Purpose

There are many situations where you may want to place a string somewhere that special characters are not allowed.
Examples include:
- **url parameter** &nbsp; 
- **embedded metadata** &nbsp; in a file or http header
- **file metadata** &nbsp; AWS S3

Standard approaches have limitations.

**BTOA/ATOB**
These fail to recover non-ASCII characters.&nbsp;
Try this:&nbsp;  atob(btoa("Î²""))&nbsp;
35% inflation.

**EncodeURI**
Ignores problematic characters.&nbsp;
See this:&nbsp;  encodeURIComponent("it's")&nbsp;

**EncodeURI** **plus** **BTOA/ATOB**
Comprehensive and safe: Encodes and decodes all characters properly in/out of Base 64.&nbsp;
Large inflation: Over 50% for most English prose

**ABBA**
ABBA is completely 'safe' -- limited character set.&nbsp;
It converts non-ASCII characters and recovers them properly.&nbsp;
Its inflation is typically less than 10%; English prose is usually shortened!&nbsp;
(Your mileage may vary.)

ABBA has hooks for easy extension, should you have an application with oft-repeated string sequences.&nbsp;


### Basic Usage

	Writer = BABYLON.MeshWriter(scene, {scale:scale});
	text1  = new Writer( 
	                "ABC",
	                {
	                    "anchor": "center",
	                    "letter-height": 50,
	                    "color": "#1C3870",
	                    "position": {
	                        "z": 20
	                    }
	                }
	            );

### Superconstructor - BABYLON.MeshWriter()

After this module is loaded, BABYLON.MeshWriter is defined.  It is called with one or two parameters.
- **scene** &nbsp; required
- **preferences** &nbsp; optional &nbsp; The preferences object may specify up to three values

	      FIELD                 DEFAULT
	    default-font           Helvetica
	    scale                      1
	    letter-origin         "letter-center"

The call to BABYLON.MeshWriter returns a constructor.  Call it "**Writer**".

### Constructor - new Writer()

new Writer() is called with a string and an (optional) options parameter.&nbsp; The options object conforms to normal BabylonJS structures and terminology.

	      FIELD                 DEFAULT
	    font-family             default-font
	    anchor                  left
	    letter-height           100
	    letter-thickness        1
	    color                   #808080              # hits emissive only
	    alpha                   1
	    position
	        x                   0
	        y                   0
	        z                   0
	    colors                                       # if you need to control more than just emissive
	        diffuse             #F0F0F0
	        specular            #000000
	        ambient             #F0F0F0
	        emissive            color                # from option field 'color' above


**new Writer()** builds a mesh with material that is inserted into the scene.&nbsp; This is a multi-step process with interim meshes and holes per letter.&nbsp;  These meshes are sucked into an SPS and then disposed.&nbsp; At the end, one mesh, one material and one SPS have been added to the scene.

**new Writer()** also returns a **writer** instance with useful methods.&nbsp; See below.

### Instance

Each **writer** instance has methods to allow one to retrieve the BabylonJS objects or to get/set attributes of the SPS.

	   getSPS
	   getMesh
	   getMaterial
	   color                   # sets or gets color but no change to material
	   alpha                   # sets or gets alpha but no change to material
	   setColor                # set emissive color and change color value
	   setAlpha                # change value and material
	   overrideOpac            # change material but not value
	   resetOpac               # sets material to current value
	   dispose                 

### Usage Hints

If you wish to do extensive things with position, rotation or animation, retrieve the meshes and materials from the instance using the methods shown above.&nbsp; The output from **new Writer()** is an SPS with one particle for each character.

Colors:&nbsp; With most lighting, it is enough just to use the "color" field to specify the letter coloring.&nbsp; However, programmers may specify all four color types by putting a "colors" object in the options object.


### Fonts

There are four font families available, 'Helvetica', 'HirukoPro-Book', 'Jura', 'Comic' and 'WebGL-Dings but you probably do not need to specify one.&nbsp; The default font, Helvetica, has the most extensive characters and the fewest faces; it will be the most efficient if you have a lot of text.&nbsp; Jura was added because the author likes it for numbers.

**Important:** Comic and Web-Dings are really just placeholders as of this writing, with only a few glyphs.
